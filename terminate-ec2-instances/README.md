# Terminate EC2 instances

<br>

## Overview
- Automatically terminate or stop abnormally created EC2 instances
- Track whether the number of created instances exceeds a predefined threshold

<br>

## Solution
### Overview

1. Event occurs
2. Event recorded in CloudTrail logs
3. Logs saved in CloudWatch and metrics extracted
4. CloudWatch alarm triggered
5. SNS sends email notification
6. Lambda function executes (automated response)

<br>

### Lambda Function Creation

**Path:** Lambda → Functions → Create function

- Author from scratch
- Function name: `Responder_StopEC2Instances`
- Runtime: Python 3.9
- Architecture: x86_64
- Create function

<br>

### Lambda Function Permission Settings

**Path:** Configuration → Permissions → Select role under Role name → Add permissions

Attach the following policy named `EC2-Policy`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<br>

### Lambda Function SNS Integration

**Path:** Lambda → Functions → Select function → Function overview → Add trigger

- **Source:** SNS
- **SNS topic:** `AbnormalEC2RunInstances`
- The Lambda function is triggered when the `AbnormalEC2RunInstances` alarm is published.

<br>

## Results
### EC2 Instance
- Automatically stops recently created instances when an alarm is triggered.
